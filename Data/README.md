# Data Folder

In the Folder *Processed_Data/Wine*, you will find the data sets to train the category **Wine**. You can download the datasets **Kindle** and **Magazine_Subscriptions** from [here](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/w2qGeO8Eh9KLdps). Store the downloaded folders in *Preprocessed_Data/*.

The data sets from the folder *Raw_Data/*, which we received from Julian McAuley (see http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/), will not be made available for download. Please contact Michael BÃ¼hler if you need them.
