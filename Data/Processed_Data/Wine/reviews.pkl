p3
aVIt was a great hit .
p4
aVIt started up a lot of conversation and the hostess immediately opened the bottle at the party .
p5
aVThe wine is a mellow fruity wine with just enough body to call it a red .
p6
aVVery drinkable for cocktails and would pair nicely with almost any party platter .

aVIts a great wine and conversation starter .
p9
aVThis wine is fruity ,  spicy ,  and well-balanced .
p10
aVAn excellent pick for red wine lovers ,  and a great gift !
p11
aVSomeone should go over the label ,  though .
p12
aVWhile it tells a creative story ,  the grammar could use some work .
p13
aVMy boyfriend picked this up the other night just for the design honestly ,  but oh my was it delicious !
p14
aVWe drank the entire bottle while just watching  I suggest trying this before you can't find it .
p15
aVWill definitely be buying this again .
p16
aVNo matter what the label looks like ,  This is a truly SMOOTH ,  FRUITY tasting 13 .
p17
aV7% alcohol treat .
p18
aVIt's DARK ,  and Great smelling .
p19
aVIf the label wasn't so ugly ,  Id give it for Christmas guifts .
p20
aVI can only hope the wine tastes as good as the bottle looks !

aVI bought this for a friend for Christmas and the packaging is great .

VMy friend and I were very surprised at the wonderfully different tast of this Albertina wine .
p25
aVI am afraid that I do  not know all the &#34;wine words&#34; used to describe them ,  but I can tell you that we were not disappointed one bit with our purchase .
p26
aVWe felt it was definitely worth the price !
p27
aVI purchased this wine as a gift for my daughter and husband for Christmas .
p28
aVThey raved about the taste and said it was so good they were not sharing it with company .
p29
aVThank you Albertina Winery .
p30
aVwe will be ordering again .
p31
aVThis mixed pack was first sent to us from a dear friend in Italy .
p32
aVWhat a luscious gift .
p33
aVEach glass is more interesting than the last .
p34
aVThe final glass in the Merlot was so rich and layered .
p35
aVI had to have more .
p36
aVUnder the guise of a birthday present to my husband ,  I ordered more .
p37
aVWe are so pleased we are planning to send it as a wedding gift this summer .
p38
aVWhether you choose to gift yourself or someone else ,  this is an exquisite choice .
p39
aVExcellent work Fred !
p40
aVVery very very good !
p41
aVI ordered these for my lovely ladies birthday and we were very surprised !
p42
aVThey even expedited the order in time for her birthday- I think it's because her name is Albertina too .
p43
aVSo far the Cab sauv is our favorite .
p44
aVKeep up the grape work !
p45
aVI really enjoyed this wine !
p46
aVI do recommend this to anyone who enjoys good wine .
p47
aVPrice is also good .

VYou're really buying the Rock Star names for fun ,  not great wine ,  though they are passable and drinkable ,  not my favorites .
p52
aVThought I'd try them for the fun of it .
p53
aVThis will be a one time thing for me .
p54
aVThere are better wines out there for the price .
p55
aVMy friend is a fan of all things Rolling Stones ,  so imagine how pleased I was to discover the 50th Anniversary collector wine !
p56
aVI ordered the Collector's Edition Mixed Pack ,  because my daughter loves The Police ,  and there was a Pink Floyd Sauvignon as an added bonus for me .
p57
aVDespite bad weather ,  the shipment arrived in good time for my friend's March 1st birthday .
p58
aVThe packaging was sturdy and the bottles in pristine condition .
p59
aVI was informed of the status of my order every step of the way ,  and would definitely continue to order from Wines That Rock !
p60
aVI received this as a gift .
p61
aVAs a classic rock fan ,  I love the bottles .
p62
aVDrinkability-wise ,  they are all OK .
p63
aVMy favorite was the 2011 Merlot &#34;Rolling Stones&#34; bottle .
p64
aVNext would be the 2011 Cab that was &#34;Pink Floyd&#34; and finally the &#34;Police&#34;I will save the empties on a shelf in the basement as mementos .
p65
aVThese wine bottles look fantastic ,  what a great gft for the aging &#34;rock stars&#34; on my gift list .
p66
aVCannot speak to the quality of the wine because we don't want to open the bottle .
p67
aVCustomer service was fantastic too .

aVOn a scale of 1-10 of wine tasting ,  I would consider myself a 4 or 5 ,  and I really enjoyed this pinot .

p83
aVEveryone raved about it .
p84
aVThank you .
p85
aVThis is an incredible wine !
p86
aVI have been a Robert Mondavi wine drinker for 30 plus years and it's clear that the family knows wine making .
p87
aVWhile I have only tried the Pinot Noir ,  I can imagine the others will be as good as this since it is quite evident that Rob Jr has learned everything his father knew about wine making .
p88
aVThis was gifted  ,  so the review given is from receiver  &#34;So good !
p89
aVReally smooth and fruity !
p90
aV&#34;I plan to order this for Christmas to try firsthand .
p91
aVWe do appreciate the support for animals in ordering this wine .
p92
aVBeing a 2011 wine this is a bit outdated .
p93
aVWine is a lot like milk when it gets outdated it smells a little funny .
p94
aVThis wine tasted a bit like grape Koolaid mixed with Sprite .
p95
aVIt would go well with Fish sticks or Captain Crunch .
p96
aVWould go for a 2013 or 2014 for freshness if I were you .

VFifty Shades of Grey ,  White Silk just moved to the top of my list of favorite wines .
p100
aVA little sweet--a little acidic--just the perfect balance for my taste .
p101
aVHi , I ordered this item as a gift for a friend .
p102
aVMy friend received it and he loved it !
p103
aVAlready drank the white wine (which is a favorite of his) and said that he is looking forward to drinking the red .
p104
aVMy overall ratings are for the delivery service a 5 (UPS) ,  Deep Valley Cellars customer service a 10 ,  and the product label and taste a 10 .
p105
aVMy friend didn't get his gift until weeks later but Deep Valley Cellars customer service fixed it immediately .
p106
aVWould definitely recommend this to others and order from Deep Valley Cellars again !
p107
aVAlthough ,  i usually prefer red wines ,  i have to say the White Silk is very good .
p108
aVRed Satin is a fair wine ,  but the taste is not really worth the price tag .
p109
aVI wasn't too disappointed because like most things ,   I saw it as paying for the &#34;brand&#34; .
p110
aVI might be willing to purchase the Red Satin again (at its current price) if it was available in a local store .
p111
aVBut that cost + shipping + wait time .
p112
aVnot really worth it .
p113
aVSide note about this seller Fast shipping ,   excellent care and packaging .

aVAwesome seller .
p115
aVthese wines complimented a maine lobster gift i gave to my son and daughterinlaw .

aVthey wondered if i was hinting for more grandchildren ,  , i've got 7 ,  4 are theirs ,  i liked the label and they haven't tasted it yet ,  so i don't know about that .

VI got a crate of this from a friend and I&#8217;ll be displaying most of the bottles in my coffee shop ,  but I couldn&#8217;t help but keep two to myself .
p124
aVThe first taste was simply exhilarating ,  with the essence of the wine flowing through the scent ,  taste and texture .
p125
aVThis is simply among the best reds I have ever tasted ,  which is the reason for this review .
p126
aVFoxen Winery produces among the highest grade wines that you can find ,  year in and year out .
p127
aVI have purchased from this winery for many ,  many years ,  and never once have been disappointed .
p128
aVFor example ,  this cabernet is outstanding; lots of dark berries ,  plum and current on the palate .
p129
aVWonderful .
p130
aVI bought this for my mom for mother's day since she LOVES wine ,  especially Cabernet Sauvignon .
p131
aVShe said ,  &#34;This is one of the best wines I have EVER tasted&#34; and she's tasted a lot of wine in her days !
p132
aVHaha !
p133
aVWill definitely be purchasing again .
p134
aVThis tastes better than any Cabernet I have ever had .
p135
aVIt's richer ,  fuller bodied ,  and a more flavorful version of what a Cabernet should be .
p136
aVTry it and see for yourself .
p137
aVI'll definitely be ordering again .
p138
aVOne of the best Cab's on the Central Coast .

aVif you like wine or have experience with other spritzers .
p148
aVGood Luck !
p149
aVBlahhh !
p150
aVThe only reason I did not give this delightful beverage 5 stars ,  is it needs a corked bottle to allow a vacuum seal plug to be used after opening to maintain the just opened flavor .
p151
aVThis is a great beverage to quench a thirst without too much effect from alcohol content .
p152
aVMeh ,  not horrible & certainly cuts a few calories innovatively .
p153
aVTrue enophiles will grow tired of the watered-down nature of it ,  electrolytes notwithstanding .
p154
aVHowever I see it as a giving Skinny Girl a run for its money if enough people are aware of it .

p167
aVI'm no wine critic but I do enjoy all three of these .
p168
aVThe rose is my favorite followed by the white & then the red .
p169
aVWorth the money to try as it has been nice to find something unseen locally in NW Colorado .
p170
aVI especially love the twist caps !
p171
aVI had a glass from each bottle when I received them and just re opend them a few months later the other day (I was participating in a challenge for a few months and couldn't drink wine) they haven't fermented !
p172
aVI've keep them in the basement in their sides away from sun and heat .
p173
aVI'm happy the bottles lasted !
p174
aVI thought that I wanted sweet wine but I don't .
p175
aVThe company really delivered what they advertise as Sweet Bliss Sweet Sampler I would like to buy other wines from the company .
p176
aVJust maybe a more earthy taste next time .
p177
aVThe white wine was very good ,  my husband wants me to order more of .
p178
aVThe pink was pretty good but nothing spectacular .
p179
aVWe haven't opened the red yet .

VMy wife and I had visited various Santa Inez Valley wineries over the years ,  interspersed with trips to the Napa and Sonoma area .
p187
aVAt some point we ventured out the road as far as Foxen and found a delightful little &#34;shack&#34; serving up some of the best wines we had tasted in California .
p188
aVWe have been going back ever since .
p189
aVWe joined the club several years back and have never been disappointed in the selections sent .
p190
aVWhile we still buy other wines on our sojourns ,  Foxen remains our primary source of fine wines .
p191
aVI have lived in California and have been drinking wines for many years and have especially liked the wines of the Napa Valley but once I discovered the wines of the area around Santa Barbara and Paseo Robles I have just loved that area and find the wines offered at Foxen to be the best of the area .
p192
aVThey are 5 stars in my book
p193
aVWe've had Foxen at the top of our &#34;favorites list&#34; for many years and the Tinaquaic Vineyard wines are very special and always unique .
p194
aVI just hope Amazon doesn't make them so popular that they'll sell out even faster !
p195
aVHaving belonged to Foxen Winery's club since its inception ,  I can vouch for the quality of wines that are produced by this winery .
p196
aVTheir chardonnay is always nuanced ,  with loads of pear ,  apricote and vanilla .
p197
aVYum ,  yum .
p198
aVI usually avoid Chardonnay but never refuse a Foxen Chardonnay .

p205
aVWe've tried other wines from this winery as well and they're all quite good .

aVIf ever I'm in need of a gift for a rock music lover ,  I order wine from &#34;wines that rock&#34;
p207
aVAnd taste good too .
p208
aVI'm normally a big fan of a Pinot Noir ,  but Merlot is my 2nd choice .
p209
aVI have to say I bought this wine because of the bottle .
p210
aVIt is not heavy ,  and similar to a Pinot .
p211
aVI bought 3 of them .
p212
aVGreat bottle to bring over as a gift especially to your Rock n Roll friends ,  and great to enjoy on your own .
p213
aVI will keep one on display and will order more when I run out .
p214
aVVery cool ,  they should make more rock n roll wine bottles but in a Pinot Noir .
p215
aVSome of the wine enthusiasts that I know often turn their noses up wines with popular themes .
p216
aVThey don&#8217;t consider them to be &#8220;Refined Taste&#8221; material .

aVSo I let them drink this wine as a surprise one time and put them in their place .
p218

aVI put on a version of Atom Heart Mother from 1970 and blasted it ,  and poured myself a glass of the Wines That Rock Pink Floyd 2009 Cabernet .
p279
aVYessssss .
p280
aVFor a sub-$20 California cabernet this is actually pretty darned good wine .
p281
aVAnd the fact that it's labeled with DSOTM makes it a neat conversation piece with fellow Floydians when you're sitting down to watch Dark Side of the Rainbow (which we did ,  and served this wine with a dozen hard-core fanatics - went over quite well thankyouverymuch) .
p282
aVSo slap your favorite pre-WYWH Floyd album on the turntable (yes ,  you can put on DSOTM if you must) ,  turn it up to 11 ,  pour yourself a glass of this wine ,  and toast Roger ,  David ,  Nick ,  and Rick (RIP) .

p344
aVI'd say that was about right .
p345
aVOf the three OneHope varieties ,  I have tried so far ,  this one is the most drinkable .
p346
aVIt is thin in body ,  but the fruit is cherry-like and pleasant .
p347
aVThe wine does tend toward the sour end of the acidic spectrum .
p348
aVIt is easily overpowered by food .
p349
aVThe oak is present ,  but not overwhelming .
p350
aVMy main problem with it is its light body and thin texture .
p351
aVI prefer big full bodied reds with big fruit finishes .
p352
aVI won't buy again ,  but at least I don't regret buying this one .
p353
aVThis wine was very good .
p354
aVI took a chance because my husband is the wine expert ,  but he loved it I'm happy to say .
p355
aVI love this wine ,  I think it's one of oneHopes best reds .
p356
aVIt's got a great taste and it usually worked out well as a gift especially when you're not sure of someone's favorite wine ,  this is usually a good guess that most people liked .
p357
aVPlus they give 50% of their profits to charities ,  which great causes behind each wine ,  (this one gives to  support Autism) .
p358
aVMy first thought was either this will be extremely expensive (it isn't) or else it will be cheap in price and quality (it's not) .
p359
aVThe quality is awesome ,  the price is affordable and the causes are great .
p360
aVIt's such a good extra way to give back (while rewarding yourself or someone else) .
p361
aVThis wine has a great flavor .
p362
aVNot too sweet and not too dry .
p363
aVIt has very nice fruity and wood undertones .
p364
aVIt is great for any occasion .
p365
aVI would recommend this to anybody who enjoys red wine .
p366
aVWe had a blind tasting in Los Angeles where my friend brown bagged 20 cabernets .
p367
aVEach of us brought one .
p368
aVFor the most part people brought pretty fancy bottles .
p369
aVI brought this Cab and it took SECOND only behind a grgich hills 2008 Cabernet that was more than 2X as expensive .
p370
aVNeedless to say I was feeling pretty good about my choice -)

VJust another average wine .
p374
aVNothing bad to say about it .
p375
aVThere is nothing special about it .
p376
aVYou can find just as good or better at the grocery store for the same price or less .
p377
aVI bought it to give away ,  so it served its purpose .
p378
aVI am an enthusiastic red wine drinker and particularly like Syrah ,  except for this one !
p379
aVIt was too acidic ,  and lacked the layered taste of every other Syrah I've ever tasted .
p380
aVThis is a very nice / good Syrah .
p381
aVWe finally had a chance to Open a bottle recently and thoroughly enjoyed it .
p382
aVI'm not much for tasting notes but it was very robust and flavorful .
p383
aVIt went well with The italian dinner we had prepared at home .
p384
aVI would highly recommend this one for the wine rack and to share with company .
p385
aVThough I admit  I don't know a lot about wines ,  this wine was very delicious and a was a good price when I bought it on sale .
p386
aVMy husband ,  friends and I liked this Syrah so much ,  I ordered a full case of it  Smooth ,  mellow ,  no bite .
p387
aVyummy !

VThe Quady Electra Moscato is so good .
p391
aVIt's very sweet ,  so its perfect as a dessert wine or a sweet treat .
p392
aVJust get it .
p393
aVIts delicious .
p394
aVI love sweet drinks so yeah I'm a chick drink type of person .
p395
aVBut I love dessert wines and this is one of the tastiest I've ever tried .
p396
aVI based my purchase on other shopper reviews here on Amazon and as usual I was not led astray .
p397
aVVery smooth and sweet ,  really it's all you need for dessert !
p398
aVDelicious !
p399
aVI will buy again !
p400
aVI am not a drinker ,  but I love this wine .
p401
aVThis is perfect for those like me who don't enjoy the taste of alcohol .
p402
aVI tried another Moscato a few weeks back and it took me two hours to finish a small half glass .
p403
aVUsually wine ,  no matter how fruity or delicious is smells ,  tastes like cold medicine to me .
p404
aVNot so with this one .
p405
aVThat's why I call it dangerously good .
p406
aVIt's easy to drink and so delicious that I have no trouble finishing a glass .
p407
aVI also appreciated that there was a handwritten note thanking me for my order on the invoice .
p408
aVThis wine is perfect for a summer bridal shower ,  turn it into a slushy and it is EPIC !
p409
aVI would highly recommend ,  especially for anyone who doesn't usually like wine .
p410
aVQuady Electra Orange Muscato is the quintessential dessert wine .

VLove this sparkling wine .
p417
aVI was afraid of having a brut .
p418
aVSome of the bruts I have had weren't the greatest (though some were good) .
p419
aVBut this is seriously one of the best sparkling wines I have ever had !
p420
aVI usually drink Asti Spumanti from Martini and Rossi on special occasions ,  and at big parties I have had a mix of other sparkling wines .
p421
aVBut this is one of my top favs .
p422
aVI was tempted to order the whole case for myself !
p423
aVI have trouble comparing it to any other sparkling unless I drank them back to back .
p424
aVNot to mention it has a great cause behind it that OneHope wine gives 50% of its profits to ,  end childhood hunger .
p425
aVBuying this actually provides meals for people who need them !
p426
aVPleasant wine that can get you addicted with only one swallow .
p427
aVBought it to celebrate my sister's 60th birthday and now I'm buying more to celebrate me for finding this treasure !
p428
aVThere's nothing not to like about One Hope Brut .
p429
aVI'm not a sweet wine drinker and think the exact amount of dryness contributes to the mellowness of this rich and yet soft sparkling wine .
p430
aVMore please .
p431
aVThis took a long time to arrive ,  so if ordering in hot or freezing weather ,  keep that in mind .
p432
aVWe thought this was okay .
p433
aVWe bought it during a big promotion ($8 or so a bottle) and we think we got our money's worth .
p434
aVIf I were to spend $14-$18 I would buy Mumm Napa Brut Prestige or a mid-range ,  dry Proseco .
p435
aVBut ,  this was not bad .
p436
aVNicely dry with flavors of granny smith and tropical fruit .
p437
aVCrisp ,  smallish bubbles are pleasant .
p438
aVLike all of the OneHope wines ,  it is a tad acidic ,  but it makes great cocktails ,  especially a St Germain .
p439
aVI enjoy this sparkling wine  for celebrations .
p440
aVI love to put a raspberry in it .
p441
aVIt makes a good gift and it is nice that Hope Wine donates to cherity .
p442
aVThis has a dry ,  fruity aroma .
p443
aVIt is also dry on the palate with a slightly bitter finish .
p444
aVThere is a slightly sour fruit flavor to it as well .
p445
aVIt's not bad ,  but I've had much better for less money .

VI had bought this wine because I work at a rock and roll themed resturant and I heard plenty of customers rave about it .
p449
aVUnfortunatly ,  though my work will not allow me to directly buy bottles from them ,  so I figured I would order one .
p450
aVThis wine is soooo good ,  its so smooth and vanilla-caramelish with a distinct berry taste ,  I plan to buy many more bottles and would highly recommend it to any red wine lover out there .
p451
aVBought the wine for a deadhead friend and really did not expect it top be anything special .
p452
aVOpened it up last night and we were both pleasantly surprised with the liquid inside .
p453
aVA bit earthy to start with  and not too heavy with the tannins on the end .
p454
aVVery much recommend this wine .
p455
aVbought a 3 pack to sample before buying more to use as gifts for all my deadhead brethren .
p456
aVwine is delightfully smooth ,  goes down all to easy .
p457
aVwill definitely be saving a few bottles for myself and buying a few more
p458
aVGave this wine as a gift to a dear friend that is a wine lover .

VI found ONEHOPE WINE to be an excellent company to deal with .
p466
aVOne of my bottles broke to the extreme weather changes around the holidays .
p467
aVThey got back to me quickly and sent a replacement bottle .
p468
aVI enjoy wine but don't know a lot about choosing a good bottle .
p469
aVThis mixed pack allowed me to try three different reds .
p470
aVI enjoyed them all very much and plan to reorder .
p471
aVI will feel comfortable taking these bottles as house gifts due to the quality .
p472
aVI also plan to send them as gifts to my wine loving family and friends .
p473
aVONE HOPE Supports charities that I care about so it's a win / win for me .
p474
aVSpecial wine to share with friends over dinner or even just for the two of us .
p475
aVGave a set to a friend for Christmas and she raved about it ,  so bought some for ourselves ,  Great !
p476
aVFlavorful ,  the quality was good ,  got them for a treat to  my friends ,  I am confident that they will like the taste
p477
aVSo this wine tastes good and supports good causes .
p478
aVI really liked the Pinot Noir and loved how it supported finding homes for pets .
p479
aVEach type of wine they sell gives half their profits to different charities .

VDecided to try this out as a gift for my wife for X-mas .
p484
aVLet me say that it worked out great .
p485
aVShe loved the wines and shipping only took a couple of days so it arrived perfectly on time .
p486
aVOnly bad thing is that you have to be home for it to be delivered since it's booze and you have to provide proof of age .
p487
aVThat was expected though and so doesn't rate removing a star .
p488
aVI like a middle of the road kind of wine .
p489
aVNot too sweet not too dry .
p490
aVThis fits the bill .
p491
aVIt leaves a wonderful taste on your tongue .
p492
aVI'm not a wine specialist but I can say this is a great buy .
p493
aVI was going to buy some more but looks like they are out of stock .
p494
aVHighly recommended .
p495
aVI purchased this on line from my Wisconsin easy chair and had it mailed for one cent to my brother in San Diego .
p496
aVTen days later I called and he and a friend had already finished off the &#34;tall one .
p497
aV&#34;  They just loved it !
p498
aVFor the Holidays I ordered my mother a spa basket ,  my dad some movies and this wine .

VMy wife and I had visited various Santa Inez Valley wineries over the years ,  interspersed with trips to the Napa and Sonoma area .
p504
aVAt some point we ventured out the road as far as Foxen and found a delightful little &#34;shack&#34; serving up some of the best wines we had tasted in California .
p505
aVWe have been going back ever since .
p506
aVWe joined the club several years back and have never been disappointed in the selections sent .
p507
aVWhile we still buy other wines on our sojourns ,  Foxen remains our primary source of fine wines .
p508
aVPinot Noir is my personal favorite of all the varieties of wines .
p509
aVI don't claim to be able to judge wines or describe their characteristics .
p510
aVI only know what I like and don't like .
p511
aVThere hasn't been a Foxen pinot I haven't liked !
p512
aVMany wineries have fine wines but we haven't found another yet that provides the level of service and assistance the staff at Foxen provides .
p513
aVQuestions about what wines to serve with what foods or just general questions are always answered promptly and thoroughly .
p514
aVWe could just wait for our wines to arrive at the house but we always seem to find excuses to drive there ,  at least in part to become more educated .
p515
aVI am a member of the Foxen Anchor Club - I joined because I fell in love with the high end Foxen Pinots - and I have been very pleased with their mid-priced options as well .
p516
aVI would hold onto the 2012 for a couple of years to see how it ages .
p517
aVI have some 2009s and 2011s which have been delicious .
p518
aVTry the Syrah when you get a chance !
p519
aVPretty much everything that foxen produces is quality and you will enjoy .
p520
aVTheir Pinots ,  however ,  are what you will enjoy the most .
p521
aVThe Santa Maria uses grapes from multiple vineyards and is an excellent value .
p522
aVIt great to enjoy now ,  but you can also age it for a few years .
p523
aVI'm a big Pinot Noir fan and just got back from a 10 day tour of Pinot country in Oregon .
p524
aVHowever ,  I find that my old standby from Foxen is every bit as good as any we had up there .
p525
aVIf you love Pinot like I do ,  you must try this one .
p526
aVFoxen Wines are consistently rated among the top pinot noirs by Robert Parker and the Wine Spectator .
p527
aVI look forward to receiving them every time they are offered .
p528
aVYou can't go wrong with Foxen wines .
